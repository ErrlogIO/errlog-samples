The readme.md file is updated by the deplyo package.

It takes the readme-base.md + releases.md, and concatenates them.

This means we only need to update the releases.md file for each new release (if we want to).

The releases.md file is also used by ELWeb for display purposes, hence it being separate as we dont care about readme.md in ELWeb
